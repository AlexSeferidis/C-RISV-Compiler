## Project Organisation ##

Our overall plan was designed so that each week we could incrementally finish in the 4 week project span:

- Week 1 - 26/02/2024
- Week 2 - 04/03/2024
- Week 3 - 11/03/2024
- Week 4 - 18/03/2024

We largely overestimated the scope of the project and actually spent longer than we realised we needed to on setting up the context with symbol tables, stack infrustructure etc.

We had set up all this by mid week 3 (e.g function definitions, parameters etc). This allowed us to then start implementing everything else which lead to faster progress once the infrastructure was in place.
